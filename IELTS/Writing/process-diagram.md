You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.

The diagram illustrates the process that is used to manufacture bricks for the building industry.
Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

Write at least 150 words.

-----------------------------------------

The diagram explains the way in which bricks are made for the building industry.
Overall, there are seven stages in the process, beginning with the digging up of clay and culminating in delivery.


To begin, the clay used to make the bricks is dug up from the ground by a large digger.
This clay is then placed onto a mental grid, which is used to break up the clay into smaller pieces.
A roller assists in this process.

Following this, sand and water are added to the clay, and this mixture is turned into bricks by either placing it into mould or using a wire cutter.
Next, these bricks are placed in an even to dry for 24 - 28 hours.

In the subsequent stage, the bricks go through a heating and cooling process.
They are heated in a klin at a moderate and then a high temperature(ranging from 200c to 1300c), followed by a cooling process in a chamber for 2 - 3 days.
Finally, the bricks are packed and delivered to their destinations.

The diagram shows how tea leaves are processed into five tea types.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

-----------------------------------------

The diagram presents the manufacture of five different types of tea.
It is immediately apparent that although all teas are produced from the same leaf, the differences in the manufacturing process result in five different types of tea.

The first three stages of manufacture are the same for all of the five teas.
The leaves are grown, they are then plunked, and following this withering of leaves occures.
The final stage is also the same, which sees all the leaves dried in an oven.
However, in the stages in between this, differing methods of production are employed.

To begin, white tea is unique as it involves no other processing.
In contrast, green, oolong and large leaf black tea are all rolled as part of the process.
However, while green tea is steamed before being rolled but is not fermented, the other two are first rolled and then both fermented(oolong only slightly but large leaf back completely).
Finally, small leaf back tea is neither steamed nor rolled, but is crushed before fully fermented.

The illustrations show how chocolate is produced.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

Write at least 150 words.

-----------------------------------------

The diagram explains the process for the making of chocolate.
There are a total of ten stages in the process, beginning with the growing of the pods on the cacao trees and culminating in the production of the chocolate.

To begin, the cocoa comes from the cocoa tree, which is grown in the South America and African continents and the country of Indonesia.
Once the pods are ripe and red, they are havested and the white cocoa beans are removed.
Following a period of fermentation, they are then laid out on a large tray so they can dry under the sun.

Next, they are placed into large sacks and delivered to the factory.
They are then roasted at a temperature of 350 degrees, after which the beans are crushed and seperated from their outer shell.
In the final stage, this inner part left is pressed and the chocolate is produced.
