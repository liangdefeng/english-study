CHAPTER 7

Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which unfortunately for his daughers, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.
  She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and suceeded him in the business, and a brother settled in Londan in a respectable line of trade.
  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their mind were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to a muse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in generaly might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.
  Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officer's names and connections.Their lodging were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.
